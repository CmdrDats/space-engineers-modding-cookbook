# Space Engineers Modding Cookbook
Modding (Plugins and In-Game Scripting) Cookbook for Space Engineers.

The goal of this repo is to gather together various tips and techniques for modding different parts of Space Engineers.

A large part of this will be information from the amazing Space Engineers modding community at large, and most of the code will be distillations of techniques used by various mods on the Steam Workshop. I will try my very best to reference and give credit where applicable.

Each of the cookbook entries will have a sample mod that should be fully functional for what it is trying to illustrate.

To be entirely clear - going forward, 'IGS' or In Game Scripting will refer to the code that you can paste into a programmable block in-game. 'Modding' will refer to a mod that you put into the mods folder of your Space Engineers data folder. 'Plugin' refers to a .dll that fundamentally alters the game itself.

The IGS part is fully shared concepts that can be applied at all levels, so we'll cover a single entry on how to use an IGS inside a mod and then you can use any of the IGS scripting concepts inside a normal mod.
